- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed **locally**, OR an **Atlas cluster** set up with access credentials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Your Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-classroom-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   
2. **Connect to MongoDB (Choose One)**

- Local MongoDB: Ensure your MongoDB server is running (mongod).

- MongoDB Atlas: Note your connection URI and credentials.

3. **Run the Insert Script**

Open mongosh and execute the insert script:

mongosh
use bookstore
load("insert_books.js")

This creates a books collection in a bookstore database and inserts all sample book documents.

## Running Queries

Once the data is inserted, you can open queries.js and copy-paste each section into the mongosh shell.

### OR
If you‚Äôre using Node.js and want to run queries via script execution:

Update the connection code in a Node.js environment (e.g., using mongodb package).

Wrap query blocks in functions and call them via a main script.
